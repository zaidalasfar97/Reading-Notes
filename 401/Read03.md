# True or false: The route handler is middleware?
###### True.

# In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
###### Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes the middleware succeeding the current middleware.
