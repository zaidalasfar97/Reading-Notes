# Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
#### TDD creates a detailed specification.
#### TDD reduces time spent on rework.
#### You spend less time in the debugger.

# In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
#### The difference is beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests, which 1. removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and 2. invites inexperienced users to share state between tests.

# What is one downside of Test Driven Development
#### Slow process.


# Why REST?
##### REST is much easier than other approaches such as SOAP which keeps developers from having to reinvent the wheel as far as HTTP request operations go. SOAP also requires separate server and client programs.

##### Since REST is based on standard HTTP operations, it uses verbs with specific meanings such as "get" or "delete" which avoids ambiguity. Resources are assigned individual URIs, adding flexibility.

##### With REST, information that is produced and consumed is separated from the technologies that facilitate production and consumption. As a result, REST performs well, is highly scalable, simple, and easy to modify and extend.


# Terms:

### functional programming:
##### Software is composed using pure functions (avoid shared state, mutable data, side-effects) If functions are interrelated, changing one function could break everything else
### object-oriented programming (OOP) :
###### computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.
### class:
##### Classes formalize the common JavaScript pattern of simulating class-like inheritance hierarchies using functions and prototypes.
### super:
###### The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
### this:
##### This refers to the current object being instantiated
### Test Driven Development (TDD):
###### Refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (unit tests), and design (refactoring)
### Jest:
###### JavaScript Testing Framework; Jest runs previously failed tests first and reorganizes runs based on how long test files take
### Continuous Integration (CI):
###### Consistent merging from multiple places into one multiple time a day
### REST:
###### Representational State Transfer. Uses HTTP requests to retrieve/use data
### Data Model:
###### Data model is a diagram that illustrates relationships and behaviors of different pieces of an application and how those pieces depend on one another


# SQL vs NoSQL Database:
#### 1.SQL databases are relational, NoSQL are non-relational.
#### 2.SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
#### 3.SQL databases are vertically scalable, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
#### 4.SQL databases are table based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph or wide-column stores.
#### 5.SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, NoSQL are better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
