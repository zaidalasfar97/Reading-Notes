##  Can a parent component access the state of a child component?
#### In React we can access the child's state using Refs. we will assign a Refs for the child component in the parent component. then using Refs we can access the child's state.

## What can be passed along in a prop variable?
#### Property or method. 

## How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
#### 1. Using Props
#### 2. Using React ContextAPI or State management library like Redux.
#### 3. Using Props as Callback Function.


## Term:
#### Component props:Props are arguments passed into React components. Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.

#### Component state:An object that determines how that component renders & behaves. In other words, “state” is what allows you to create components that are dynamic and interactive.

#### application state:Represents the totality of everything necessary to keep your application running.

## React Basic :

#### 1. The Component Lifecycle: Mounting , Updating ,Unmounting.

#### 2. Higher-Order Components:You may have used higher-order components, or HOCs, already. Redux’s connect function.

#### 3. React State and setState():Most of you have probably used React state, we even used it in our HOC example. But it’s important to understand that when there’s a state change, React will trigger a re-render on that component (unless you specify in shouldComponentUpdate to say otherwise).


## props.children:Is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.
