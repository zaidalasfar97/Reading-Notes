# What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
##### FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

# How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
##### Client sends a request to server, Server receives a request ,Server sends a response ,Client receives a response

# What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
##### The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handlingsystems, in "event driven" software.
