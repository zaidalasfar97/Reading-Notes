# What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage” 
### Cookies are read server-side, and local storage is read client-side, so if the server needs the data, then it is better to use cookies.
# Explain 3rd party cookies.
#### Third-party cookies are cookies that are set by a website other than the one you are currently on. For example, you can have a "Like" button on your website which will store a cookie on a visitor's computer, that cookie can later be accessed by Facebook to identify visitors and see which websites he visited.
# How do pixel tags work?
### Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online.

# Term
### cookies :They are pieces of code that web servers use to put information on a user’s browser, and then retrieve that information at a later time for various uses.
### authorization :  is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features
### access control :is a fundamental component of data security that dictates who’s allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data.
### conditional rendering : Conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false. In React, it allows us to render different elements or components based on a condition. This concept is applied often in the following scenarios: Rendering external data from an API.


# Redux : 
### React Redux is the official React UI bindings layer for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update state.

## Technical benefits of using Redux.
####  Predictable states. The state is always predictable in Redux. 
#### Ease in maintenance. 
#### Debugging is easy. 
#### Testing code is simple. 
#### Server rendering. 
#### Vast developer tools available. 
#### Great supportive community. 
#### Reusable Code.
