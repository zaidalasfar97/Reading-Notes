# When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization? 
#### The Basic and Digest authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret .
#### The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token .

# What does the JSON Web Token package do?
#### Is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.

# What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
#### Use encryption to store secrets within .git repositories.
#### Use environment variables.
#### Use “Secrets as a service” solutions.


# Encryption:
#### Is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.
# bearer:
#### Is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.
# secret : 
#### Is private to you which means you will never reveal that to the public or inject inside the JWT token.
# JSON Web Token :
#### Is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.


# RBAC :
#### RBAC is nothing more than the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.
