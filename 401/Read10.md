# What is a Stack
### A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.


## Common terminology for a stack is :

### 1-Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
### 2-Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
### 3-Top - This is the top of the stack.
### 4-Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
### 5-IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.



# Stacks follow these concepts:

### FILO
### First In Last Out

### This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

### LIFO
### Last In First Out

### This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.
