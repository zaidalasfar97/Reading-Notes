# Why is access control important? 
### Access control is important because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource. ... Without proper access control you could leave your staff and your company wide open to problems such as data loss, theft or breach of privacy and data protection laws. 

# What is a role used for?

###### Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations.RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. Although RBAC is different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any complication.


# Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
###### An organization assigns a role-based access control role to every employee; the role determines which permissions the system grants to the user. For example, you can designate whether a user is an administrator, a specialist, or an end-user, and limit access to specific resources or tasks. An organization may let some individuals create or modify files while providing others with viewing permission only.


# Term:
#### Authorization :
###### Authorization is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features. This is the process of granting or denying access to a network resource which allows the user access to various resources based on the user's identity.

#### Role Based Access Control:
###### restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

# Event-Driven Programming in Node.js : 
##### Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision

## Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

##### An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
##### A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.
