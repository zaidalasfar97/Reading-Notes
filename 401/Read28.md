### global state : In the causal domain, a global state is a set of local states which are all concurrent with each other. By concurrent, we mean that no two states have a cause and effect relationship with each other.
### global context : This global context is not just about studying the time and place of an event. It also means looking at how the event has made an impact on personal as well as global history

### consumer : 	This is a React component that subscribes to context changes in value of the Provider.


# what is role based access control? 
#### Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

#### Through RBAC, you can control what end-users can do at both broad and granular levels. You can designate whether the user is an administrator, a specialist user, or an end-user, and align roles and access permissions with your employees’ positions in the organization. Permissions are allocated only with enough access as needed for employees to do their jobs.

## Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

#### 1-Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
#### 2-Management role group – you can add and remove members.
#### 3-Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
#### 4-Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.


## BENEFITS OF RBAC :
#### 1-Reducing administrative work and IT support. 
#### 2-Maximizing operational efficiency. 
#### 3-Improving compliance.
