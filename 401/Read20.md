# What’s the difference between a framework and a library? 
### The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow.

# Term : 
### Rendering : refers to showing the output in the browser. The DOM establishes parent-child relationships, and adjacent sibling relationships, among the various elements in the HTML file.

### Templates : refers to the client side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language. This approach became popular thanks to JavaScript's increased use, its increase in client processing capabilities, and the trend to outsource computations to the client's web browser. 

### State: the state is how something is; its configuration, attributes, condition or information content.

# React : 
### It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

# Rendering an Element into the DOM :
### We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

### Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

### To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render().
